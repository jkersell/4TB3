(1) S -> A
(2) A -> epsilon
(3) A -> aA

Proof: productions of this grammar have only one form.

(1) must be followed by (2) or (3), and (3) may be followed by (3) (repeatedly) or (2). (2) is terminal.
Therefore all productions of this grammar are of the form (1)[(3)]*(2).

Proof: induction

base case (n=0):
    (1)->(2) produces (epsilon)

inductive case:
    Assume a^n is in L(G)

    Prove a^(n+1) is in L(G):

    (1)->[(3) n times]->(3)->(2)
